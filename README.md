# Clinical-SQL-Project
In this recent project, I successfully leveraged advanced SQL techniques to identify patients matching the criteria of a clinical trial listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. By utilizing custom Common Table Expressions (CTEs), I was able to extract granular patient data, aligning it with the trial's specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. This approach facilitated the development of step-by-step metrics, providing valuable insights into the potential study population (NSCLC patients) and ensuring compliance with the clinical trial guidelines.
